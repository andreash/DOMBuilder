====================
DOMBuilder CHANGELOG
====================

2011-01-20
----------

- ``Tag`` objects created when in HTML mode now remember which mode was
  active when they were created, as they may not be coerced until a later
  time, when the mode may have changed.
- Added ``DOMBuilder.withMode`` to switch to HTML mode for the scope of a
  function call.
- Fixed short circuiting in element creation functions and decreased the
  number of checks required to determine which of the 4 supported argument
  combinations the user passed in.

2009-06-25
----------

- Attributes are now lowercased when generating HTML.
- Added and exposed an ``isSafe`` function - ``isSafe`` and ``markSafe``
  are the public API for managing escaping of strings when generating HTML.

2009-06-23
----------

- Added support for using the DOMBuilder API to generate HTML/XHTML output
  instead of DOM elements. This is an experimental change for using the same
  codebase to generate HTML on the backend and DOM elements on the frontend
  with the same codebase, as is currently being implemented in
  http://code.google.com/p/js-forms/

Version 1.1
===========

Packaged from revision 12 in Subversion.

2008-10-08
----------

- An ``NBSP`` property is now also added to the context object by
  ``DOMBuilder.apply()``, for convenience.

2008-10-07
----------

- Boolean attributes are now only set if they're ``true``. Added items to
  the demo page to demonstrate that you can now create an *explicitly*
  unchecked checkbox and an explicity non-multiple select.

2008-06-22
----------

- Added more IE workarounds for:
  - Creating multiple selects
  - Creating pre-selected radio and checkbox inputs

Version 1.0
===========

Packaged from revision 5 in Subversion.

2008-05-31
----------

- Added support for passing children to element creation function as Arrays.
- Added more robust support for registering event handlers, including
  cross-browser event handling utility methods and context correction for IE
  when the event handler is fired.
- IE detection is now performed once and once only, using conditional
  compilation rather than useragent string inspection.
