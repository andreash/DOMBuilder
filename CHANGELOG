====================
DOMBuilder CHANGELOG
====================

2011-01-26
----------

- Issue #3 -  we now detect DOM Elements and coerce everything else to
  String when appending.
- Bit the bullet and switched to using jQuery for element creation and
  more.

2011-01-25
----------

- Fixed issue #2 - nested Arrays in child arguments to createElement and
  fragment are now flattened.
- Fixed modification of attributes by mapping functions.
- Added support for Boolean children in DOM mode.

2011-01-24
----------

- ``document`` is now passed in so code shrinkers can munge it.
- Added ``"value"`` to the property access for IE7 proper.
- Fixed a horrible IE bug in the ``extend`` utility method :(
- Fixed a bug in ``DOMBuilder.map`` - ``DOMBuilder.createElement`` expects
  children to be in an array.
- Extracted ``HTMLNode`` base class to contain common logic from
  ``HTMLElement`` and ``HTMLFragment``.
- Renamed ``Tag`` to ``HTMLElement``.
- ``DOMBuilder.fragment`` now works in HTML mode - ``HTMLFragment`` objects
  lightly mimic the ``DocumentFragment`` API.
- Added ``DOMBuilder.map``.

2011-01-23
----------

- Now detects which fixes are needed based on the version and document
  mode of IE.
- Folded special case handling into ``createElement`` as parts of it were
  needed to correct ``defaultValue`` and others in the nice browsers.
  Added private properties to DOMBuilder to support special cases.
- Added ``DOMBuilder.fragment``, a utility method for creating and
  populating ``DocumentFragment`` objects.

Version 1.2
===========

Packaged from revision 23 in Subversion.

2011-01-21
----------

- Created Sphinx docs.

2011-01-20
----------

- ``Tag`` objects created when in HTML mode now remember which mode was
  active when they were created, as they may not be coerced until a later
  time, when the mode may have changed.
- Added ``DOMBuilder.withMode`` to switch to HTML mode for the scope of a
  function call.
- Fixed short circuiting in element creation functions and decreased the
  number of checks required to determine which of the 4 supported argument
  combinations the user passed in.

2009-06-25
----------

- Attributes are now lowercased when generating HTML.
- Added and exposed an ``isSafe`` function - ``isSafe`` and ``markSafe``
  are the public API for managing escaping of strings when generating HTML.

2009-06-23
----------

- Added support for using the DOMBuilder API to generate HTML/XHTML output
  instead of DOM elements. This is an experimental change for using the same
  codebase to generate HTML on the backend and DOM elements on the frontend
  with the same codebase, as is currently being implemented in
  http://code.google.com/p/js-forms/

Version 1.1
===========

Packaged from revision 12 in Subversion.

2008-10-08
----------

- An ``NBSP`` property is now also added to the context object by
  ``DOMBuilder.apply()``, for convenience.

2008-10-07
----------

- Boolean attributes are now only set if they're ``true``. Added items to
  the demo page to demonstrate that you can now create an *explicitly*
  unchecked checkbox and an explicity non-multiple select.

2008-06-22
----------

- Added more IE workarounds for:
  - Creating multiple selects
  - Creating pre-selected radio and checkbox inputs

Version 1.0
===========

Packaged from revision 5 in Subversion.

2008-05-31
----------

- Added support for passing children to element creation function as Arrays.
- Added more robust support for registering event handlers, including
  cross-browser event handling utility methods and context correction for IE
  when the event handler is fired.
- IE detection is now performed once and once only, using conditional
  compilation rather than useragent string inspection.
