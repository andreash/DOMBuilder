CHANGELOG
=========

2008-05-31
----------

- Added support for more varieties of DOM element function arguments.
- Added more robust support for registering event handlers, including
  cross-browser event handling utility methods and context correction for IE
  when the event handler is fired.
- IE detection is now performed once and once only, using conditional
  compilation rather than userAgent string inspection.
